# JupyterHub

Docker image with the goal of spawning a JupyterHub Docker container alongside singleuser notebook containers.

It should do so by controlling its parent docker daemon.

Currently in an unfinished state.

See https://github.com/TiemenSch/tiniconda/tree/master/util for the helper commands used in the image.
